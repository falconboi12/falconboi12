## About Me

"A precipitous slope, a narrow river width, a fast and violent flow. Due to the terrain and the external influence, the state of the water is perfectly decided. And yet, water obeys only itself. Water is only water. Thoroughly water. Absolutely free." <br>
-- Miyamoto Musashi, Chapter 305: "The Water Path"

I am Sarthak Anand, a junior undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology (BHU), Varanasi, India. Navigating through binary or bridges, I am pursuing my degree in Civil Engineering and Computer Science. Apart from academia, I am interested in the whizzing speeds of motorsports, nuances of orchestrating checkmates, or deep diving in the world of ancient philosophers.

📅 Duration: May'23 - Jul'23

*Description:*

- **Development and Analysis of Alkali Activated Materials (AAM):** Explored the use of various supplementary cementitious materials, including fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag, to address environmental and waste management challenges in the concrete industry. Investigated the effects of various additives like NaOH and sucrose on the properties and hardening of AAMs.

- **Advanced Testing & Characterization of AAMs:** Conducted a range of tests, such as flow retention, compressive & flexural strength, ultrasonic pulse velocity, water accessible porosity, and shrinkage. Utilized advanced techniques like X-Ray Diffraction, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, and Scanning Electron Microscope for detailed microstructural analysis of the material.

- **Exploration of 3D Printing with AAMs:** Delved into the principles of 3D printing, focusing on the challenges and requirements of printing with alkali-activated materials. Assessed critical parameters like pumpability, extrudability, and buildability. Also, investigated potential defects in 3D printing and their implications on the final structure.

- **Implementation of Modern Technologies:** Introduced the concept of ultra-sonication to improve dissolution processes at the nano-scale and examined the potential benefits of using technologies like 3D printing for the rapid construction of structures using alkali-activated materials. Also, considered post-processing techniques to optimize the strength and durability of the printed structures.

The experimental results obtained were novel and cannot be shared exclusively, without its publication.

### Conceptualising Digital Twin for a SDOF system with varying coefficients 

Engaged in an exploratory project guided by Associate Professor [Dr. Basuraj Bhowmik]([[url]([https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/civ/people/basurajciv])])


*📅 Duration:*  Jan ’23-Apr ’23

*Description:*

- Developed a digital twin in MATLAB for a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system with variable mass and stiffness coefficients.
- Employed Gaussian Process regression to model the relationship between mass, stiffness, and angular frequency.
- Iteratively refined model, optimizing both basis and kernel functions for precise system representation.
- Utilized the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for model evaluation, striving for the lowest BIC score.
- Final model delivered predictive insights into the interplay between mass and stiffness changes.
  -- Employed exponential decay in stiffness and periodic change in mass coefficient, the performance of the model is shown as below. 

This endeavour seamlessly merged theoretical insights with practical application, exemplifying my commitment to pushing the boundaries of engineering knowledge.
